# Sorting-Esolang
This is my own stack-based esolang for sorting algorithms<br />
Still a work in progress<br /><br />

The main array is passed to the program itself<br />
Since this is a stack-based esolang, operations like `(2 + 2) * 4 + 5` need to be written as `2 2 + 4 * 5 +`
<br /><br />
This esolang is used to implement sorting algorithms
